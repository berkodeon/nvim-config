# My Neovim Config
From environment to environment, I realized I reconfigure my neovim config and I wanted to merge all my personal configuration by creating this repo while refactoring and using latest versions.

# Next TODOs
- [X] Paranthesis matcher
- [X] Add Pyton LSP
- [X] Add Rust LSP
- [] Python and Pyton debugger
- [] Cloak
- [] Zenmode


# In case we need to install another auto-completion plugin, here is the source:

# After installation
- Run `:checkhealth`!
